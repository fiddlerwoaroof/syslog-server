* Introduction

This is a minimal implementation of a syslog-like protocol that is
tested against a minimal syslog daemon included with Gentoo, rsyslogd
and OpenWRT's log daemon.  This also includes a command line program
that listens for incoming syslog connections, pretty prints them and
then saves them to an sqlite db in /tmp/logs.db.

By default, this client includes the ability to recognize dnsmasq's log
entries and record them to their own tables.

The db needs to be precreated with this schema:

#+BEGIN_SRC SQL
create table messages (severity int, facility int, tag text, pid int, message text, host text, ts datetime default current_timestamp);
create table dns_query (query_type text, request text, requester text, added text default current_timestamp);
create table dns_reply (query text, reply text, added datetime default current_timestamp);
#+END_SRC


* TODO

- other db backends
- customizable db paths
- batch db updates
- improve filtering command line options
- TUI / CLIM ui
